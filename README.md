# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction

This project predicts airline ticket prices using supervised machine learning. The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction?resource=download) 

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict flight prices based on flight details
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Dataset:** Real-world flight pricing data from Kaggle

## 🧪 Key Steps
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, feature engineering)
- Train-test split
- Hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`
- Model evaluation using R², MAE, MSE

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high R² score (~0.98)
- Random Forest outperformed baseline models
